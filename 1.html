 <h3>It's been a long day without you, my friend
 <br><u>And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again</u>
<br>We've come a long way from where we began
<br>Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

<br><h3>You've been runnin' round, runnin' round,
<br>runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name
<br><strong>'Cause you knew that I, knew
<br>that I, knew that I'd call you up</strong>
<br>You've been going round, going round,
<br>going round every party in LA
<br>'Cause you knew that I,
<br>knew that I, knew that I'd be at one</h3>

<h2>Faded</h2>
<br><h3>You were the shadow to my light
<br>Did you feel us
<br>Another start
<br>You fade away
<br><strong>Afraid our aim is out of sight</strong>
<br>Wanna see us
<br>Alive</h3>
